Language is the primary mean of communication among human for thousands of years. For a community, the language contained the words that the people need to communicate. Words indicate the meaning, they point to objects or actions. The computer has a set of hardware, and software components that need to communicate with each other. The language that is used for making the interaction between these components is called the programming language. The computer can read a file from your disk storage using programming language. A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.
